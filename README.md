# üñ•Ô∏è My Journey in the RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program

Welcome! This repository chronicles my progress and learnings as I participate in the **VLSI System Design (VSD) RISC-V System-on-Chip (SoC) Tapeout Program**. My goal is to document each stage of the journey, from digital logic design to the final physical layout.

This intensive program provides hands-on training in designing a complete SoC, taking a concept from a **Register Transfer Level (RTL) description** down to the **GDSII file format** required for fabrication. As part of a national initiative, it leverages open-source EDA tools to empower engineers and students to contribute to India‚Äôs growing semiconductor ecosystem.

## üìÖ Week 0: Foundation and Tool Setup

The first week focused on establishing a robust development environment by installing and verifying essential open-source **Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools**.

| Task | Core Tools Installed                                                       | Status |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| 0    | Icarus Verilog (Simulation), Yosys (Synthesis), GTKWave (Waveform Viewing) | ‚úÖ      |
|      |
|       
**üìù Installation Guide:**
For a detailed, step-by-step tutorial on installing and configuring these tools, please see the dedicated README in the **[Week 0](https://github.com/jyothirganesh-0475/Jyothirganesh_K_RISC-V-SoC-VSD_Week_0/tree/main/Tool_Check_snapshots#readme)** folder.

### üåü Key Learnings from This Stage

* Gained hands-on experience configuring a Linux environment for digital design work.
* Developed a foundational understanding of the role each tool plays in the RTL-to-GDSII flow.
* Successfully compiled and simulated a test Verilog module to ensure the toolchain was fully operational.

### üôè Acknowledgments

This learning experience would not be possible without the guidance of **[Kunal Ghosh](https://github.com/kunalg123)** and the entire **VLSI System Design (VSD) Team**.

I am also thankful for the support from the broader semiconductor community, including:

* **RISC-V International**
* **India Semiconductor Mission (ISM)**
* **VLSI Society of India (VSI)**
* **IIT Gandhinagar**
